--- MAYBE ---

GLOBAL:
- create "filters" for the feed (superposable, date, user, etc...)
- make it possible to change the superposable's size (use resize in the back)

API:
- implement tests for every route and structure

FRONT:
- add the superposable picture to camera feed
- find a way to access 'Constants' env variables
- remove useless labels (when labeled element is nested inside)
- make it possible to submit message by pressing 'Enter'
- fix prepend fail on image upload (image appears before filters button)
