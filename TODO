--- TODO ---

GLOBAL:
- implement mail logic (find a way to send mail from the backend)

FRONT:
- get and show user data in profile
- add an email notification checkbox in the profile
- create edition page with current webcam view or an uploaded picture and a pepe
  selector, and also a side section for previously created pictures

FIX:
- panic when trying to connect with generated users (I think this is because the
  password hash is wrong)

--- MAYBE ---

GLOBAL:
- create "filters" for the feed (like the superposable, the date, the user,
  etc...)
- add documentation about the populate scripts in README (maybe "clean" the
  logic so that it is simpler to use)
- maybe try and find a way to use an ENV variable to populate the database

API:
- implement tests for every route and structures
- try and use environment variables for some constants (maybe create a config
  module and initialize it once at launch)
- Check every unwrap() call. Remove the ones that should be removed (where a
  failure might happen and should be handled cleanly), and replace the others
  with expect calls to make sure we know what's going on.
- check the queries for unhandled failure (basically use the rows_affected
  value instead of returning an Ok(()))
- create superposable enum in db and add this information to pictures table

FRONT:
- make sure this shit looks good on mobile ("displays correctly")
- use classes and ids instead of tags for the styling (more reliable)
