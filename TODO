--- TODO ---

- add documentation/comments on the environment variables (like how HOST_IP_BIND
  is used to forbid outside connections)
- update the documentation for the "local network part" because now the
  HOST_IP_BIND must be changed too (set to an empty string or removed so that
  containers can communicate with the outside network)

--- MAYBE ---

GLOBAL:
- make it possible to change the superposable's size (use resize in the back)

API:
- reply with an error when the API tries to send a mail and fails because the
  SMTP credentials were not provided in the environment
- implement tests for every route and structure

FRONT:
- beautify emails
- fix footer visibility/scroll on smartphone
- fix picture loading so that the pepe-post informations do not appear before
  the picture (find a way to do it in sync, maybe use 'onload' on the picture
  if possible and possibly even add a spinner!)
- fix ugly scroll on chrome and macOS too (apparently) (maybe just remove every
  'overflow-[xy]: scroll;' lmfao, or only on hover)
- add the superposable picture to camera feed
- remove the share-dialog from pepe-posts and only use the web share API when
  it is well implemented everywhere
