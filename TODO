--- MAYBE ---

GLOBAL:
- create "filters" for the feed (like the superposable, the date, the user,
  etc...)
- add documentation about the populate scripts in README (maybe "clean" the
  logic so that it is simpler to use)
- try and find a way to use an ENV variable to populate the database
- make it possible to change the superposable's size (use resize in the back)

API:
- implement tests for every route and structures
- Check every unwrap() call. Remove the ones that should be removed (where a
  failure might happen and should be handled cleanly), and replace the others
  with expect calls to make sure we know what's going on.
- check the queries for unhandled failure (basically use the rows_affected
  value instead of returning an Ok(()))
- create superposable enum in db and add this information to pictures table

FRONT:
- use classes and ids instead of tags for the styling (more reliable)
- beautify confirm page (maybe add loader or something)
- add the superposable picture to camera feed
