--- TODO ---

GLOBAL:
- implement mail logic (find a way to send mail from the backend)

FRONT:
- make sure that the formats are valid when creating and/or uploading pictures
  from the editor to the backend
- show the 'empty-gallery' div when deleting there is no picture left in the
  sidebar (simply add this in the onDeletePost handler)
- add the superposable picture to camera feed and preview

FIX:
- Some pictures can be missing from the sidebar in the editor. I have seen this
  by manually removing every picture and then refreshing the page, two 'new'
  pictures appeared. After deleting them and reloading the list was indeed
  empty. This is the gallery scroll that does not work or is not implemented
  correctly.
- reset the comment section status when switching picture (the bar appears
  without the comments when the previous pictures comments were visible)
  or make it appear (the first option is better)

--- MAYBE ---

GLOBAL:
- better notifications (maybe replace alerts)
- create "filters" for the feed (like the superposable, the date, the user,
  etc...)
- add documentation about the populate scripts in README (maybe "clean" the
  logic so that it is simpler to use)
- try and find a way to use an ENV variable to populate the database
- make it possible to change the superposable's size (use resize in the back)

API:
- implement tests for every route and structures
- try and use environment variables for some constants (maybe create a config
  module and initialize it once at launch)
- Check every unwrap() call. Remove the ones that should be removed (where a
  failure might happen and should be handled cleanly), and replace the others
  with expect calls to make sure we know what's going on.
- check the queries for unhandled failure (basically use the rows_affected
  value instead of returning an Ok(()))
- create superposable enum in db and add this information to pictures table

FRONT:
- make sure this shit looks good on mobile ("displays correctly")
- use classes and ids instead of tags for the styling (more reliable)
