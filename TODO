--- MAYBE ---

GLOBAL:
- create "filters" for the feed (like the superposable, the date, the user,
  etc...)
- add documentation about the populate scripts in README (maybe "clean" the
  logic so that it is simpler to use)
- make it possible to change the superposable's size (use resize in the back)

API:
- implement tests for every route and structures
- create superposable enum in db and add this information to pictures table

FRONT:
- use classes and ids instead of tags for the styling (more reliable)
- beautify confirm page (maybe add loader or something)
- add the superposable picture to camera feed
