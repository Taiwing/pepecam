--- TODO ---

- setup HTTPS on VPS and make it so it is easy to switch back and forth between
  a localhost setup and the live one (maybe an env variable)
- find out why the api fails on VPS, or rather why the api does not wait for the
  db setup to be finished before launching as it seems to do on a local machine
- fix ugly scroll on chrome and macOS too (apparently) (maybe just remove every
  'overflow-[xy]: scroll;' lmfao, or only on hover)
- fix footer visibility/scroll on smartphone
- fix picture loading so that the pepe-post informations do not appear before
  the picture (find a way to do it in sync, maybe use 'onload' on the picture
  if possible and possibly even add a spinner!)

--- MAYBE ---

GLOBAL:
- make it possible to change the superposable's size (use resize in the back)

API:
- implement tests for every route and structure

FRONT:
- add the superposable picture to camera feed
- find a way to access 'Constants' env variables
- remove the share-dialog from pepe-posts and only use the web share API when
  it is well implemented everywhere
