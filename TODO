- implement tests for every route and structures
- try and use environment variables for some constants (maybe create a config
  module and initialize it once at launch)
- Check every unwrap() call. Remove the ones that should be removed (where a
  failure might happen and should be handled cleanly), and replace the others
  with expect calls to make sure we know what's going on.
