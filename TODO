--- TODO ---

- handle the different API_PORTS and FRONT_PORTS (the LOCAL and the PUBLIC)
- see how to handle the different FRONT_LINK values between the VPS and the
  local versions of the app (maybe simply create a third env file for
  production like .env.prod and add instructions in the README)

--- MAYBE ---

GLOBAL:
- make it possible to change the superposable's size (use resize in the back)

API:
- implement tests for every route and structure

FRONT:
- beautify emails
- fix footer visibility/scroll on smartphone
- fix picture loading so that the pepe-post informations do not appear before
  the picture (find a way to do it in sync, maybe use 'onload' on the picture
  if possible and possibly even add a spinner!)
- fix ugly scroll on chrome and macOS too (apparently) (maybe just remove every
  'overflow-[xy]: scroll;' lmfao, or only on hover)
- add the superposable picture to camera feed
- remove the share-dialog from pepe-posts and only use the web share API when
  it is well implemented everywhere
