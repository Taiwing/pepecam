--- MAYBE ---

GLOBAL:
- replace every occurence of '[Cc]amagru' by '[Pp]epecam' and rename the current
  directory
- create "filters" for the feed (like the superposable, the date, the user,
  etc...)
- add documentation about the populate scripts in README (maybe "clean" the
  logic so that it is simpler to use)
- make it possible to change the superposable's size (use resize in the back)
- add doc about environment and secrets

API:
- if secrets are not set (SMTP values for now), make it so the API can still
  compile but without the email functions (warn user in the doc and/or with a
  message somewhere during compilation or on launch)
- implement tests for every route and structures
- create superposable enum in db and add this information to pictures table

FRONT:
- beautify confirm page (maybe add loader or something)
- add the superposable picture to camera feed
