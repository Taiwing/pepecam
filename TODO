--- MAYBE ---

GLOBAL:
- replace every occurence of '[Cc]amagru' by '[Pp]epecam' and rename the current
  directory
- create "filters" for the feed (like the superposable, the date, the user,
  etc...)
- make it possible to change the superposable's size (use resize in the back)
- add doc about the scripts (mainly for picture generation)

API:
- implement tests for every route and structures
- create superposable enum in db and add this information to pictures table

FRONT:
- add the superposable picture to camera feed
- find a way to access 'Constants' env variables (because right now everything
  is hardcoded...)
